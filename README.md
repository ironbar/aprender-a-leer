# Aprender a leer en español

Una sencilla aplicación web para aprender a leer en español: empezando por las vocales, siguiendo con las sílabas y terminando con palabras.

## Specification

This specification is given to Sonnet 4.5 to create the website.

```
Let's create a website to learn to read in spanish. It will have three tabs: "Vocales", "Sílabas", "Palabras"

All the tabs have the same functionality: the user clicks on the screen an a random new letter, pairs of letters or words appear. Always a different text will be shown. There is a button to toogle between lower and upper letters on all of the tabs. W

In the first tab the user will click in the screen and a random vowel will be shown.

In the second tab there is a menu with all the consonant letters in spanish. The user can toogle each letter
to condition the generation of syllable. When the user clicks the screen a random syllabe will be generated
using the active consonants and any of the vowels (the vowel always goes after the consonant)

In the third tab there is a slider to select the number of letters of the word. It will start with 3 letters and end with 10 letters. Let's leave the functionality of this tab not implemented by now because I have to find
a list of words.

The website should be very simple, using html, javascript and css because it will be hosted directly in github.
Try to create a very minimal but friendly style for the kids that are learning to read.

First write a plan of how you are going to create the website.
